**Client:** University of Bristol Library Services.

The client predominantly provides access to a large number print materials (such of books and digital content) to the existing 18000+ University of Bristol members. Graduates, former staff, members of local societies as well as members of universities in the UK & Ireland part of the SCONUL Access Scheme can also apply for memberships and become members but these are subject to individual review. There is also visitor passes available however print materials cannot be issued to such members.

As part of a new upgrade going live in January 2019, the client will be upgrading their library management system to a new cloud based setup hosted by OCLC and managed by WMS. In addition to these upgrades, the client loves the idea of developing an app for their existing members to self-issue print materials. This would negate the need for existing members to use the librarian or the self service machines to take out materials as they would be able to do on the fly, with their phones via their fingertips. 

Four main parts to the system:

University of Bristol Library Services

Mobile apps projects

University of Bristol Library Services comprises 9 libraries and 4 study centres. We operate across the print and digital environments, with a print book collection of approximately 1 million titles and an equally large volume of digital content. Library Services supports all students and staff at the University of Bristol.

Key central library services are managed by a library management system. This is currently being replaced with a new library services platform which will go live in January 2019. This new service, WorldShare Management Services (WMS) will be supplied as a software as a service solution by the supplier OCLC. WMS will also provide a new discovery service to find, locate and access all library materials, both print and digital. This will replace the current Library Search service.

The following are some of the mobile apps that we are keen to develop. We would welcome the opportunity to work with University of Bristol students to develop these. We believe that this would be both an excellent learning experience for students but would also allow Library Services to work in the co-design of future service offerings.

1. Mobile self-issue app
    The aim is to develop a mobile app that would allow library users to issue print materials to themselves via their mobile device. This would take advantage of technologies available by the library and by mobile phone manufacturers.
    Library materials are currently issued to users on dedicated stand-alone workstations within our libraries. These machines read the user Ucard to identify the borrower and the RFID tag inside each book to identify the item. The kiosk then communicates with the core library system via the SIP2 protocol to update the borrower record on the central system and de-sensitise the security setting on the RFID tag in the book.

    Moving this operation to the users own mobile device would require that the near field communications (NFC) functionality on the device is used to interact with the RFID tag which would then, in turn, interact with the central system via SIP2.
    The output of this project would be a mobile app that is able to carry out these tasks of reading the borrower Ucard, the RFID tag, and communicating back to the central system. The user experience would be that of a significantly enhanced and flexible service for issuing books to themselves.

2. Push notifications for user transactions:
    This app would develop notifications for library users about the status of items that they have on loan. For example, when an item that is out on loan is required by another library user this title is recalled on the central library system. The library user then receives a recall notification, currently an e-mail. The aim of this app would be to replace the e-mail notifications with push notification direct to the user’s mobile device. It is envisioned that this app would work based on Bluetooth beacons to transmit the push notifications.
    Notification Scenarios:
        - User is notified when the book is (not) renewed
        - Night before book is due
        - Morning when book is due
