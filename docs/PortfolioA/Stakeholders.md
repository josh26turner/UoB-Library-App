# List of Stakeholders:

1. Students/Library Customers
	* Ease of use. Quicker than using the librarian and quick scan machines as can be done while walking out.
	* Saves those with social anxiety from having to communicate with library staff around.
	* Easy to access. Anyone with a phone can reserve a book or renew a book anywhere anytime.
	* Students who are not able to access the app may be at disadvantage when trying to reserve a book.

1. Librarians
	* They may need to explain how the app works. We may need to provide first-hand instructions of the logic of the app. We can however attempt to avoid this problem by adding tutorial upon first opening the app. 
	* It will shorten their workload. Librarians will only have to interact with those who do not have access to the app.
	* Number of librarians may be reduced.

1. Library service staff
	* They will be providing requirements. What function we need to implement in the app.
	* They will be in charge of distribution and providing maintenance.

1. Customer Service representatives
	* They will have to provide technical support including explaining how the app works and direct users to the download page of the app. 

1. OCWS staff
	* OCWS is the api provider of the current library service. The app will need to be updated if there was any change to the api.
	
1. IT Services
	* They will be in charge of distribution of the app on Google Play Store and providing maintenance and updates of future versions of the app.
